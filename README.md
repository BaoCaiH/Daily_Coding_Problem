# DailyCodingProblem
Solutions to problems received daily from dailycodingproblem.com

The solutions are stored by their type so either clone the whole repository
or just the type you need.
As of today, the solutions is in Python 3

[Update] From 2019-04-19, ipynb file will no longer be added, only python file

## Setup

[Update]

I use Python 3 on MacOS through Atom with Hydrogen installed.

### Mac

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

`brew install python3
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install jupyter`

Only these are needed. Atom need to be installed separately if jupyter is not
preferable. Atom has connection to git as well so bonus.

Install [Atom](https://atom.io/)

If atom is used, install [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen)
extension.

Also setup the [ipykernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)

### Window

You won't have python pre-installed so install it first

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) is a good way to start in Window

Anaconda will come with Jupyter notebook pre-installed and the solution can be
run in Jupyter notebook

### Linux

Linux will have python pre-installed, I guess, at least Mint has

Not Jupyter notebook though. Install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)


## Run Solutions

Clone or download the Python repository

Open the file in Atom or Jupyter

OR

Run the desire solution file:

`cd [path_to_directory]`

`python "[filename]"`
