# DailyCodingProblem
Solutions to problems received daily from dailycodingproblem.com

The solutions are stored by their type so either clone the whole repository or just the type you need.
As of today, the solutions is in Python 3

[Update] From 2019-04-19, ipynb file will no longer be added, only python file

## Setup

I recommend Jupyter notebook to run the solution for maximum clarity

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) is a great way to have Jupyter notebook together with some other IDE like Spyder

### Window

You won't have python pre-installed so install it first

Again [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) is a good way to start

Anaconda will come with Jupyter notebook pre-installed and you can run the solution in Jupyter notebook, seamlessly

### Linux

Linux will have python pre-installed, I guess, at least Mint has

Not Jupyter notebook though

Clone or download the Python repository

Run the desire solution file

`python "[filename]"`

### Mac

Similar to Linux, Mac will have python so you can run just like python
